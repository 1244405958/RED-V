# 开发环境



## Freedom E SDK

The Freedom E SDK is a repository of demo programs, industry standard benchmarks, and board support packages (BSPs) for our hardware platforms. Running benchmark code on our development boards is as easy as building a single Makefile target.

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sifive/freedom-e-sdk.git
```



## Freedom Studio

Freedom Studio is the fastest way to get started programming with your SiFive hardware. Freedom Studio is built on top of the popular Eclipse IDE and packaged with a prebuilt toolchain and example projects from the Freedom E SDK. Freedom Studio is compatible with all SiFive RISC-V development boards.

We highly recommend downloading and reviewing the [Freedom Studio User Manual](https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/FreedomStudio/2020.06/freedom-studio-manual-4.7.2-2020-06-0.pdf) before downloading and installing Freedom Studio. This manual has important information about preparing your host system to help you get up and running as quickly as possible. Please note that the Freedom Studio IDE no longer runs on CentOS 6.

## Prebuilt RISC‑V GCC Toolchain and Emulator

Save time by using one of our prebuilt toolchains which contain all the tools necessary to compile and debug programs on SiFive products. No hardware, no problem as the QEMU emulator packages can be used to test software applications without hardware. Our toolchain and emulator distributions have been carefully packaged to support both 32-bit & 64-bit ISAs. All the available packages are built using our [Freedom Tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases) GitHub repository.

- GNU Embedded Toolchain
- OpenOCD
- QEMU
- Spike Disassembler



## Freedom U SDK

The Freedom U SDK is a repository containing everything needed to build a Linux-based board support packages (BSP) targeting SiFive hardware and emulation platforms.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sifive/freedom-u-sdk.git
```



## Pre-Built Linux BSP

Already have a HiFive Unleashed and want to get started right away? Download the latest pre-built image below and follow the instructions in [Freedom U SDK](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-u-sdk) for writing the image to the Micro SD Card.



## Third Party RISC‑V Tools

A vibrant third-party ecosystem has evolved around the free and open RISC‑V ISA. The following tools are not developed nor maintained by SiFive, but may be worth considering for your next project.

### Ashling

[Ashling](https://www.ashling.com/) is a world-class technology partner offering integrated solutions, tools, and design services that are at the heart of the embedded environment. Ashling RiscFree™ C/C++ for RISC-V, is a fully integrated development tool environment that includes an IDE, compiler, debugger, and Opella-XD JTAG probe ready to use with SiFive’s RISC-V Core IP products. A single download and install provides out of the box functionality and support for SiFive IP cores. Ashling brings in the added value of offering tools customization of any ISA extension, for both compiler and debugger, to support SiFive’s customer base.
